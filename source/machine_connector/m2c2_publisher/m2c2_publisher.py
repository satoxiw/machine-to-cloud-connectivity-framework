"""
This is the Machine To Cloud Connectivity Publisher Lambda function.
It takes data from a stream and writes it to predefined definitions

The publisher expects the payload of the messages on the stream to be the following:
{
    "alias": str,
    "messages": [
        {
            "name": alias,
            "value": various values,
            "quality": 'Good|GOOD|Bad|BAD|Uncertain|UNCERTAIN',
            "timestamp": str
        }
    ]
}
It publishes data to any of the following: SiteWise, Kinesis Data Stream, an IoT topic
